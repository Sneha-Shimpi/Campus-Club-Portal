# Campus-Club-Portal
Campus Club Portal is a centralized platform for students to explore clubs, register, participate in events, and stay updated with campus activities. Admins and club heads can manage clubs, approve memberships, and post announcements. The goal of the project is to improve communication and engagement among students and campus communities.
